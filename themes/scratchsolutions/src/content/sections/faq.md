    _Questions_
subtitle: "Common questions about AI automation for small service businesses."
faqs:
  - question: "What kind of tasks can AI automate?"
    answer: "AI can now handle many repetitive admin tasks including: writing meeting notes, sending follow-up emails, scheduling appointments, organizing client information, drafting proposals, summarizing calls, and responding to routine inquiries. Each of these might only take 10-20 minutes individually, but they add up to 5-15+ hours per week."
  - question: "Do I need to be technical to use these tools?"
    answer: "Not at all. We handle all the technical setup and configuration. The tools we recommend are designed for non-technical users—if you can use email and a calendar, you can use these tools. We also provide training to make sure you're comfortable before we're done."
  - question: "What tools do you recommend?"
    answer: "We're completely tool-agnostic—we recommend whatever works best for your specific situation and budget. This might include AI notetakers, smart scheduling assistants, automated follow-up sequences, AI writing assistants, and more. We don't have partnerships with any tool vendors, so our recommendations are based purely on what fits your needs."
  - question: "How long does implementation take?"
    answer: "Most implementations are completed within 1-2 weeks. This includes tool selection, account setup, integration configuration, and training. Simple automations can sometimes be set up in a single session."
  - question: "What does ongoing support include?"
    answer: "Our support includes monthly check-in calls, priority troubleshooting (24-hour response time), workflow adjustments as your business evolves, new tool recommendations, and team training refreshers. We want you actually using these tools months from now, not abandoning them after a week."
  - question: "How much does this cost?"
    answer: "Our pricing is designed for small businesses. A Workflow Review is a one-time investment. Implementation is based on the complexity of your needs. Ongoing support is a monthly retainer. Contact us for specific pricing based on your situation. The ROI is usually obvious within the first month—if we save you 5 hours per week, that's 20+ hours per month."
  - question: "What if the tools change or stop working?"
    answer: "Technology changes, and tools sometimes get updated or discontinued. That's one reason we offer ongoing support—we monitor your automations and make adjustments when needed. We also document everything so you're never dependent on us to understand how your systems work."
  - question: "Do you work with my industry?"
    answer: "We work with small service businesses in the Orlando area that operate primarily online, typically 1-10 employees. This includes coaches, consultants, therapists, tutors, recruiters, bookkeepers, small agencies, and course creators. The common thread is repeat client interactions and a lot of communication and documentation."
